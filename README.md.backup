## Raspberry Pi with GPS Module

### STATUS: 
- The checksum calculator works, if you need to make some checksums.   
- The UBX_CONFIG.c program kind of works. Config messages are sent to the receiver, ack/nak response is received, and both NMEA and UBX-NAV-PVT messages are received. NMEA sentences appear to be accurate (at least, the RMC message is accurate), but the NAV-PVT UBX message is showing the wrong time, date, and location. Other fields are probably also incorrect. I'm unsure about why this is, but it could be an issue with converting the hext

#### Overview: an outline of challenges I have not yet resolved
- The ZOE-M8Q GPS module supports a few different communication protocols. The two of interest to me are NMEA and the proprietary UBX protocol designed by u-blox.   
- By default, the module outputs GNSS data via NMEA 0183 sentences. The challenge with this protocol is that message length is variable if there are no values to report. For example, the NMEA RMC output provides "speed over ground" data. For a stationary module, the "spd" field in the sentence would be empty, causing the buffer array to read into the following sentence.
- UBX messages are more defined in their binary size, but the module must be configured to output UBX. And this is about as far as I've gotten. 
- The protocol documentation describes the binry/hex format of UBX messages and the formula to calculate message checksums. U-blox also provided the U-Center graphical tool, available only on Windows, to build UBX messages. Sending messages is pretty straightforward with the pigpio library. Reading responses has been a little more challenging with some mixed results.
